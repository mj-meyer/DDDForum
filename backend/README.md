# Code-First

This is my code first implementation. It's raw, doesn't use a lot of abstraction and just gets the job done.

## Running the app

Before running you'll want to run the following to generate a sql db and get the schema created:

```shell
yarn db:generate
yarn db:push
```

To start the app, you can run:

```shell
yarn start:dev
```
